# Pediatric-Pneumonia-Image-Classification

# Overview

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.


# Business Problem

We were given three different folders, a Train, Test, and Validation folder. Each section contained a different amount of photos, each labeled 'NORMAL' (0) and 'PNEUMONIA' (1). We were then tasked with building a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the images by patterns in the photos.


# Data Understanding

We were given three different folders, a Train, Test, and Validation folder. Each section contained a different amount of photos, each labeled 'NORMAL' (0) and 'PNEUMONIA' (1).


# Data Preperation & Analysis

After loading in the dataset, we did __ to prepare it to put into 


# Modeling

These are the steps we took to improve our model, basic hyperparameter tuning


# Visualizations

This shows how our network was successful 


# Conclusions

In conclusion, our model was __ accurate. We chose this model due to its X and Y features compared to other networks/models. Would be more effective with more computational power


# Next Steps

Like with every project, it is always crucial to gather more data to further improve the accuracy of our model. Also,
